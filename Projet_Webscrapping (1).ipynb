Against the backdrop of intensive longitudinal data from a computer-based tool for formative student assessment (see Tomasik... Berger & Moser, 2019, in Frontiers of Education), the successful candidate will apply and develop methods for modelling intraindividual learning trajectories and assessment characteristics across different subject domains, investigate patterns of heterogeneity in these trajectories, study the longitudinal dynamics between concepts and content domains, and investigate contextual factors predicting learning trajectories. A significant portion of the working time will be devoted to prepare the results of this modelling for publication in scientific journals and presentation at international conferences. The successful candidate might also be involved in mentoring a doctoral student.\\n\\nYour profile\\n\\nQualified candidates should be self-driven and highly motivated individuals with an established track record, including first-author publications in top-tier international journals.

The MMC aims to increase understanding of mixed migration, to positively impact global and regional migration policies, to inform evidence-based protection responses for people on the move and to stimulate forward thinking in public and policy debates on mixed migration. The MMC's overarching focus is on human rights and protection for all people on the move. The three overall objectives of the MMC are:\\n• To contribute to a better, more nuanced and balanced understanding of mixed migration (knowledge)\\n• To contribute to evidence-based and better-informed migration policies and debates (policy)\\n• To contribute to effective evidence-based protection responses for people on the move (programming)\\n\\nThe MMC is a global network, with regional hubs in Africa, Asia, Europe and Latin America hosted in DRC regional offices, and a small central team in Geneva. The MMC is part... of, and governed by, DRC. While its institutional link to DRC ensures MMC's work is grounded in operational reality, it acts as an independent source of data, research, analysis and policy development on mixed migration for policy makers, practitioners, journalists, and the broader humanitarian sector. The position of the MMC does not necessarily reflect the position of DRC. For more information on MMC visit our website here: www.mixedmigration.org\\n\\nOne of MMC’s flagship project is the (4Mi). 4Mi collects data through in-depth structured interviews, focusing on protection risks and the conditions and experiences faced by people on the move, as well as their motivation for migration. 4Mi fills information gaps around protection and vulnerabilities with a view to informing policy and humanitarian programmatic response as well as enhancing sector understanding and knowledge on migration dynamics. Aside from 4Mi data collection MMC Europe is carrying a number of other quantitative and qualitative data collection initiatives, using dedicated methodologies and tools.\\n\\nAbout the job\\n\\nIn Europe, MMC has been carrying out 4Mi data collection in Italy and Greece from 2019 to 2021, and has engaged on a number of other research initiatives and projects, all available here. The MMC is now carrying out several new initiatives, focusing on:\\n• Vulnerabilities to trafficking in persons and return intentions of people displaced from Ukraine in Central Europe;\\n• Experience and access to Assisted Voluntary Return (AVR) services for undocumented migrants in Western Europe;\\n• The impact of irregularity on access to services and employment in Italy, Greece and Spain;\\n• Access to housing of documented and undocumented migrants in Italy, Greece and Malta;\\n• Journeys toward Europe, migration-related decision making for movements within Europe and the role of public policy.\\n\\nOther thematic might arise and the MMC research remains agile to respond to pressing needs for evidence-based programming and policy development.\\n\\nReporting to the Head of MMC Europe, and with a technical reporting line to the Head of Research & 4Mi, as the Data and Research Project Manager you will be responsible for the implementation of data collection and research activities within Europe.

              "    'job_highlights': [{'items': [\"The MMC is a leading source for independent and high-quality data, research, analysis and expertise on mixed migration. The MMC aims to increase understanding of mixed migration, to positively impact global and regional migration policies, to inform evidence-based protection responses for people on the move and to stimulate forward thinking in public and policy debates on mixed migration. The MMC's overarching focus is on human rights and protection for all people on the move. The three overall objectives of the MMC are:\\n• To contribute to a better, more nuanced and balanced understanding of mixed migration (knowledge)\\n• To contribute to evidence-based and better-informed migration policies and debates (policy)\\n• To contribute to effective evidence-based protection responses for people on the move (programming)\\n\\nThe MMC is a global network, with regional hubs in Africa, Asia, Europe and Latin America hosted in DRC regional offices, and a small central team in Geneva. The MMC is part... of, and governed by, DRC. While its institutional link to DRC ensures MMC's work is grounded in operational reality, it acts as an independent source of data, research, analysis and policy development on mixed migration for policy makers, practitioners, journalists, and the broader humanitarian sector. The position of the MMC does not necessarily reflect the position of DRC. For more information on MMC visit our website here: www.mixedmigration.org\\n\\nOne of MMC’s flagship project is the (4Mi). 4Mi collects data through in-depth structured interviews, focusing on protection risks and the conditions and experiences faced by people on the move, as well as their motivation for migration. 4Mi fills information gaps around protection and vulnerabilities with a view to informing policy and humanitarian programmatic response as well as enhancing sector understanding and knowledge on migration dynamics. Aside from 4Mi data collection MMC Europe is carrying a number of other quantitative and qualitative data collection initiatives, using dedicated methodologies and tools.\\n\\nAbout the job\\n\\nIn Europe, MMC has been carrying out 4Mi data collection in Italy and Greece from 2019 to 2021, and has engaged on a number of other research initiatives and projects, all available here. The MMC is now carrying out several new initiatives, focusing on:\\n• Vulnerabilities to trafficking in persons and return intentions of people displaced from Ukraine in Central Europe;\\n• Experience and access to Assisted Voluntary Return (AVR) services for undocumented migrants in Western Europe;\\n• The impact of irregularity on access to services and employment in Italy, Greece and Spain;\\n• Access to housing of documented and undocumented migrants in Italy, Greece and Malta;\\n• Journeys toward Europe, migration-related decision making for movements within Europe and the role of public policy.\\n\\nOther thematic might arise and the MMC research remains agile to respond to pressing needs for evidence-based programming and policy development.\\n\\nReporting to the Head of MMC Europe, and with a technical reporting line to the Head of Research & 4Mi, as the Data and Research Project Manager you will be responsible for the implementation of data collection and research activities within Europe. You will be managing country Project Officers and Information Management Officers.

Founded in 1933 at the request of Albert Einstein, the IRC offers lifesaving care and life-changing assistance to refugees forced to flee from war or disaster. The IRC is on the ground in more than 40 countries, providing emergency relief, relocating refugees and rebuilding lives in the wake of disaster.

Data Standards and Governance (DSG) and 2. the Data Privacy & Sharing (DPS) Enabling Platforms (EP). This internship position will drive the design, implementation and governance of industry-wide biomedical data standards from protocol to submission in DSG and contribute to complex data privacy and sharing consultancy issues in DPS. Your educational background in life sciences and interest in clinical research/data science has given you experience in data collection and tabulation standards of safety laboratory data and you should also have a strong interest in data protection/privacy topics and value the reuse of data for further insight generation. You are going to become a key contributor in the maintenance of the standards for this critical type of data used in every single one of our clinical trials... You will also be a key contributor to the maintenance of data sharing metrics in DPS and a number of other data privacy and sharing projects as needed. You will need strong collaboration, communication and project management skills, as well as an entrepreneurial mindset, to evolve the way we collect and deliver data and to develop and deliver medicines for our patients. Responsibilities/Skills You contribute to the conceptual design of biomedical data standards from protocol to submission, their governance and their technical implementation in a metadata repository from where they are accessed for implementation on all Roche clinical studies. You are specialized on the data standards used for the collection of safety laboratory data (i.e. hematology, blood chemistry, urinalysis, etc.). You will spend an equal amount of your time working as a member of the DPS EP, strong teamwork skills and the ability to to work independently using your own initiative will be key to your success in this internship. You will gain a broad understanding of Roche’s data sharing work and will be expected to have an interest in/understanding of basic data privacy concepts. Embedded in teams of key business stakeholders, for the prioritization of the development of new biomedical data standards in your area of expertise and you lead and contribute to specialist teams within the overarching governance framework. The exchange with clinical trial teams and key business stakeholders about impact analysis, risk assessment, cost/benefit analysis, and proposals of alternatives help you and our team to understand where the needs are to continuously grow the biomedical data standards. Your specialist advice and support with the implementation of biomedical data standards to all of Biometrics and beyond is heavily relied on. As an intern in the Data Standards and Governance group you contribute to continuous improvement of our internal work processes and tools. As a group we help drive a culture based on FAIR data principles across the Roche organization. As an intern in the Data Privacy and Sharing EP you will contribute to projects which will improve oversight of our work and demonstrate the value of DPS activities. As a group we enable further insights to be generated from clinical data for patient benefit while simultaneously protecting patient privacy. Minimum requirements You are enrolled at a university or completed your studies within the past 12 months in a life science discipline. Ideally, you already have experience in applying and managing healthcare data, possibly using CDISC (CDASH, SDTM, or ADaM) industry biomedical data standards. You should also have a strong interest in data sharing, data reuse and data privacy topics. You have got an inner drive for results which you try to achieve by an analytical and structured approach. You have strong critical appraisal skills and you are comfortable taking an investigative approach to work. Paying attention to detail is important to you and you are able to deal positively with multiple requests and priorities. You are used to taking pragmatic decisions under demanding timelines. You feel comfortable in an environment where change and ambiguity are present. You equally like your independence and being embedded in global and cross-functional teams. Your excellent written and oral communication skills make you confident in communicating and presenting to all levels of the organisation and across organisational boundaries. You do not hesitate to challenge in a diplomatic and collaborative way and generate debate in teams. This is a global position which requires regular interactions with colleagues at all sites.
