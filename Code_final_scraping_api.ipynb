The growing interest in data-driven control is motivated by their ability to bypass explicit identification steps, a significant time sink in traditional control design [1, 2, 3]. This approach enables the utilization of data to directly achieve the desired control design objectives. Nevertheless... particularly in the realm of complex systems, the adoption of data-driven design strategies remains unconsolidated. This is attributed to the absence of guarantees and a comprehensive understanding of the closed-loop behavior before deploying the controller. Moreover, the increasing complexity of modern engineering systems, particularly those with multiple interacting variables, poses significant challenges. Multivariable systems exhibit intricate dynamics necessitating innovative strategies for effective control. This research aims to explore and develop advanced data-driven techniques to enhance the control performance of multivariable systems.\\n\\nThe research objectives are as follows. From a methodological point of view, the objective is to investigate how data-driven approaches can capture and exploit the interdependencies among variables to achieve superior control performance compared to traditional methods. Another pivotal aim involves assessing the robustness of data-driven control strategies in the face of uncertainties, control saturations, disturbances, and changes in system [4]. Additionally, the investigation extends to methods to incorporate prior knowledge about the system, if available, into the data-driven control design process. From a practical point of view, the goal is to validate the proposed data-driven control strategies through simulation studies and, if possible, experimental setups on a real-world application. Indeed, the work will be carried out in collaboration with Fives Cryo, a technological leader in the cryogenics market. The objective is the design of a data-based control algorithm for a vacuum brazing furnace. The major difficulties are twofold. The first relates to the very high number of inputs/outputs of the furnace (88 actuators and 49 measurement points), and the second concerns the variability of the load geometries to be considered. The aim is to overcome the controller\\'s dependence on the geometry of the part to be soldered. The thesis work will take advantage of input/output coupling analysis to propose a data-driven control law that enables furnace temperature to be controlled independently of the geometry of the part to be soldered. The results of this thesis will be validated on Fives Cryo\\'s complete digital simulator [5].\\n\\nMethodology:\\n• Conduct a comprehensive review of existing literature on data-driven control and multivariable systems.\\n• Identify the specificities of the considered real-world application, collect relevant data, and preprocess the data for analysis.\\n• Design and implement data-driven control algorithms, considering the challenges posed by considering multiple inputs and multiple outputs systems.\\n• Evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms through extensive simulations and validate the results with experimental data if possible.\\n• Compare the proposed data-driven control strategies with traditional control methods, highlighting the advantages and limitations of each approach.\\n\\nMaster internship: This research proposition encompasses the possibility of conducting a Master internship before starting a PhD. During the Master internship, the tasks involve identifying the features of the targeted real-world application, gathering pertinent data, and preprocessing the data for subsequent analysis and simulation. The primary goal is to formulate a control strategy through a free model approach, with the intent of validating it using the digital simulator provided by Fives Cryo.\\n\\nPhD: The PhD thesis offers a unique opportunity to contribute to the evolving field of data-driven control while addressing the specific challenges posed by multivariable systems in real-world applications. The main expected contribution is the development of innovative data-driven control algorithms specifically designed for multivariable systems. Furthermore, the project is part of a research consortium where the PhD candidate will interact with a mix of academic and industrial research partners. The candidate will join the research group CID (Control Identification Diagnosis) at CRAN, UMR CNRS – Université de Lorraine in Nancy (http://www.cran.univ-lorraine.fr/). The CID group research activities span all facets of systems and control theory, such as linear, nonlinear and hybrid systems theory, modelling and identification and diagnosis. The CID group has a strong interconnection with other academic institutions and industry. For prospective candidates passionate about the intersection of data-driven control methodologies, multivariable systems, and the transformative power of AI, this research offers an exciting opportunity. The collaboration with Fives Cryo ensures that the theoretical advancements contribute not only to the academic understanding of control systems but also make a tangible impact on the forefront of industrial practices within the cryogenics sector.\\n\\nPrise de fonction : 01/09/2024 Nature du financement Contrat doctoral Précisions sur le financement BPI France 2030 Présentation établissement et labo d\\'accueil CRAN -CNRS UMR 7039\\n\\nCreated in 1980, the \"Centre de Recherche en Automatique de Nancy (CRAN)\" is a joint research unit (UMR 7039) shared by the University of Lorraine (UL) and the CNRS \"Institut des sciences de l\\'information et de leurs interactions (INS2I)\".It also hosts researchers from the \"Lorraine Cancer Institute\" (ICL, Centre de lutte contre le cancer), the University Hospital., the Regional Hospital Center of Metz-Thionville and the LIST in Luxembourg-City.\\n\\nAs of January 1, 2022, the laboratory has 106 professor-researchers, 4 emeritus, 9 CNRS researchers, 9 other researchers from UL, ICL and CHU or external organizations, 13 post-doctoral fellows, 90 doctoral students and 34 (including 29 permanent and 5 fixed-term contracts) engineers, technicians or administrators.

The growing interest in data-driven control is motivated by their ability to bypass explicit identification steps, a significant time sink in traditional control design [1, 2, 3]. This approach enables the utilization of data to directly achieve the desired control design objectives. Nevertheless... particularly in the realm of complex systems, the adoption of data-driven design strategies remains unconsolidated. This is attributed to the absence of guarantees and a comprehensive understanding of the closed-loop behavior before deploying the controller. Moreover, the increasing complexity of modern engineering systems, particularly those with multiple interacting variables, poses significant challenges. Multivariable systems exhibit intricate dynamics necessitating innovative strategies for effective control. This research aims to explore and develop advanced data-driven techniques to enhance the control performance of multivariable systems.\\n\\nThe research objectives are as follows. From a methodological point of view, the objective is to investigate how data-driven approaches can capture and exploit the interdependencies among variables to achieve superior control performance compared to traditional methods. Another pivotal aim involves assessing the robustness of data-driven control strategies in the face of uncertainties, control saturations, disturbances, and changes in system [4]. Additionally, the investigation extends to methods to incorporate prior knowledge about the system, if available, into the data-driven control design process. From a practical point of view, the goal is to validate the proposed data-driven control strategies through simulation studies and, if possible, experimental setups on a real-world application. Indeed, the work will be carried out in collaboration with Fives Cryo, a technological leader in the cryogenics market. The objective is the design of a data-based control algorithm for a vacuum brazing furnace. The major difficulties are twofold. The first relates to the very high number of inputs/outputs of the furnace (88 actuators and 49 measurement points), and the second concerns the variability of the load geometries to be considered. The aim is to overcome the controller\\'s dependence on the geometry of the part to be soldered. The thesis work will take advantage of input/output coupling analysis to propose a data-driven control law that enables furnace temperature to be controlled independently of the geometry of the part to be soldered. The results of this thesis will be validated on Fives Cryo\\'s complete digital simulator [5].\\n\\nMethodology:\\n• Conduct a comprehensive review of existing literature on data-driven control and multivariable systems.\\n• Identify the specificities of the considered real-world application, collect relevant data, and preprocess the data for analysis.\\n• Design and implement data-driven control algorithms, considering the challenges posed by considering multiple inputs and multiple outputs systems.\\n• Evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms through extensive simulations and validate the results with experimental data if possible.\\n• Compare the proposed data-driven control strategies with traditional control methods, highlighting the advantages and limitations of each approach.\\n\\nMaster internship: This research proposition encompasses the possibility of conducting a Master internship before starting a PhD. During the Master internship, the tasks involve identifying the features of the targeted real-world application, gathering pertinent data, and preprocessing the data for subsequent analysis and simulation. The primary goal is to formulate a control strategy through a free model approach, with the intent of validating it using the digital simulator provided by Fives Cryo.\\n\\nPhD: The PhD thesis offers a unique opportunity to contribute to the evolving field of data-driven control while addressing the specific challenges posed by multivariable systems in real-world applications. The main expected contribution is the development of innovative data-driven control algorithms specifically designed for multivariable systems. Furthermore, the project is part of a research consortium where the PhD candidate will interact with a mix of academic and industrial research partners. The candidate will join the research group CID (Control Identification Diagnosis) at CRAN, UMR CNRS – Université de Lorraine in Nancy (http://www.cran.univ-lorraine.fr/). The CID group research activities span all facets of systems and control theory, such as linear, nonlinear and hybrid systems theory, modelling and identification and diagnosis. The CID group has a strong interconnection with other academic institutions and industry. For prospective candidates passionate about the intersection of data-driven control methodologies, multivariable systems, and the transformative power of AI, this research offers an exciting opportunity. The collaboration with Fives Cryo ensures that the theoretical advancements contribute not only to the academic understanding of control systems but also make a tangible impact on the forefront of industrial practices within the cryogenics sector.\\n\\nPrise de fonction : 01/09/2024 Nature du financement Contrat doctoral Précisions sur le financement BPI France 2030 Présentation établissement et labo d\\'accueil CRAN -CNRS UMR 7039\\n\\nCreated in 1980, the \"Centre de Recherche en Automatique de Nancy (CRAN)\" is a joint research unit (UMR 7039) shared by the University of Lorraine (UL) and the CNRS \"Institut des sciences de l\\'information et de leurs interactions (INS2I)\".It also hosts researchers from the \"Lorraine Cancer Institute\" (ICL, Centre de lutte contre le cancer), the University Hospital., the Regional Hospital Center of Metz-Thionville and the LIST in Luxembourg-City.\\n\\nAs of January 1, 2022, the laboratory has 106 professor-researchers, 4 emeritus, 9 CNRS researchers, 9 other researchers from UL, ICL and CHU or external organizations, 13 post-doctoral fellows, 90 doctoral students and 34 (including 29 permanent and 5 fixed-term contracts) engineers, technicians or administrators.

With more than 450 persons working at four different locations (Nice Observatory, Université de Nice, Sophia Antipolis, Plateau de Calern), its role is to explore, understand and transfer knowledge about Earth sciences and astronomy, whether in astrophysics, geosciences, or related sciences such as mechanics, signal processing, or... optics. OCA is composed of 3 research units (ARTEMIS, GEOAZUR, and LAGRANGE) and 1 support structure (GALILEE). This program will be developed in the Lagrange Laboratory.\\n\\nThe GaiaMoons research project, supported by the French national research agency ANR, started on 1 Dec 2022 and develops over 4 years. It aims at detecting and characterising asteroid satellites by exploiting the ultra-accurate astrometry obtained by the Gaia mission of the European Space Agency.\\nAt the level of accuracy of Gaia, astrometric discovery of satellites can become an efficient technique, potentially exploring ranges of sizes and separations that remain difficult to access from the ground. Satellites discovered by astrometry should be validated and characterised through other techniques, including photometry and stellar occultations. Fully characterised systems can give access to fundamental asteroid properties such as density and shapes. In the frame of GaiaMoons, we will also have access to remote observing facilities of Observatoire de la Côte d'Azur.\\nDescription of the position\\n• This position is for three years and is focused on exploiting Gaia data from DR3 (published in June 2023), the forthcoming Focused Data Release (FPR, due to appear by the end of 2023) and DR4.\\n• There are two main aspects that the post-doc will investigate.

              "    'job_highlights': [{'items': [\"Job offer : 3-year contract (ANR project GaiaMoons)\\n\\nLevel : PostDoc, PHD required\\n\\nSalary : 2500-2800 Euros/month\\n\\nType of position : postdoc position with research activities in Solar System science (small bodies, physical properties, observations) with a particular focus on data and signal processing.\\n\\nSituation : Université Côte d’Azur – Observatoire de la Côte d’Azur - Laboratoire LAGRANGE – Mont-Gros site in Nice & optionally Calern Observatory for observations (remote and on site)\\nDescription of Observatoire de la Côte d’Azur and GaiaMoons project\\n\\nObservatoire de la Côte d’Azur is a French public Center for research in earth sciences and astronomy. With more than 450 persons working at four different locations (Nice Observatory, Université de Nice, Sophia Antipolis, Plateau de Calern), its role is to explore, understand and transfer knowledge about Earth sciences and astronomy, whether in astrophysics, geosciences, or related sciences such as mechanics, signal processing, or... optics. OCA is composed of 3 research units (ARTEMIS, GEOAZUR, and LAGRANGE) and 1 support structure (GALILEE). This program will be developed in the Lagrange Laboratory.\\n\\nThe GaiaMoons research project, supported by the French national research agency ANR, started on 1 Dec 2022 and develops over 4 years. It aims at detecting and characterising asteroid satellites by exploiting the ultra-accurate astrometry obtained by the Gaia mission of the European Space Agency.\\nAt the level of accuracy of Gaia, astrometric discovery of satellites can become an efficient technique, potentially exploring ranges of sizes and separations that remain difficult to access from the ground. Satellites discovered by astrometry should be validated and characterised through other techniques, including photometry and stellar occultations. Fully characterised systems can give access to fundamental asteroid properties such as density and shapes. In the frame of GaiaMoons, we will also have access to remote observing facilities of Observatoire de la Côte d'Azur.\\nDescription of the position\\n• This position is for three years and is focused on exploiting Gaia data from DR3 (published in June 2023), the forthcoming Focused Data Release (FPR, due to appear by the end of 2023) and DR4.\\n• There are two main aspects that the post-doc will investigate. First, astrometry will be the main driver to discover candidate asteroid satellites, by studying possible periodic signatures in the post-fit residuals of the orbit optimisation. While this aspect has already been partially explored for consecutive sets of observations in a short interval of time, published in DR3, the search in sparse data over longer intervals requires to identify and implement new approaches.\\n• The post-doc will also exploit other data sources both from Gaia and from the ground (available photometry, spectral classification, shape, size, rotational properties) to validate the candidate detections and obtain physical parameters of the binary systems.\\n• The result will be a fully validated procedure with multiple input sources.\\n• The exploitation of Gaia DR3 (34 months of data) has shown that such a search for binaries is very promising, but the extent of FPR (5 years) and of DR4 (> 360k asteroids) will constitute a much larger sample that will grant a larger number of discoveries.\\n\\nMain activities\\n• Exploration of Gaia astrometry and photometry.\\n• Exploitation of existing data bases of additional asteroid data (in particular concerning physical properties).\\n• Code programming: period detection, signal statistics, machine learning approaches.\\n• Obtention and reduction of new observations from partner facilities.\\n• Scientific publication writing, and preparation of data bases with the results.\\n• Report writing, collaboration with the OCA team, and with the larger GaiaMoon collaboration (including Paris and Poznan observatories, plus other international partners).\\n\\nSkills\\n\\nKnowledge about asteroid physical properties is required, but equally important are the experience in data exploitation and signal analisys (characterisation of periodic signals, signal statistics).
