Context:Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) are central to ENGIE’s strategy driven by decarbonization, decentralization, and digitalization. Our ambition is to become a major player in BESS. BESS are an important piece of the global decarbonisation drive providing flexibility to systems and portfolios by replacing part of conventional generation (coal exit), complementing increasing renewables buildout (wind, solar), and supporting to balance power grids (ancillaries) and save excess energy (arbitrage). Several countries have been identified standing out as promising for BESS investments. Those countries show strong potential for capacity deployment over the coming years, driven by ambitious decarbonisation targets, projected exponential growth in renewables, and retirement of ageing conventional power plants. ENGIE is uniquely placed to deliver on these objectives as 3 Global Business Units are active in BESS deployment: front-of-the meter grid connected BESS and residential BESS (GBU TS), front-of-the meter grid-connected paired with renewables (GBU R) and behind-the-meter at client’s premises (GBU ES). Our worldwide presence, strong industrial capabilities, and local anchorage as well as a deep know-how in power management and trading (GEMS) will allow us to develop integrated solutions for systems, internal portfolio needs and our customers across the value chain: from development through construction into operations, portfolio optimization while providing ancillary services and flexible power when required. Our ambition is to become a BESS player present in key markets worldwide providing flexibility while extracting value from the embedded optionality offered by deploying BESS.To succeed in this rapidly evolving business, Engie want to embrace digital technologies as part of its strategy to bring differentiating solutions and protect its competitive advantages.

We provide data-driven insurance products based on satellite imagery and IoT to protect corporate and public sector clients against climate risk and natural catastrophes. Following a Series A funding of 18m USD in September 2020, we opened offices in New York, Houston, Singapore, Sydney and London. Today, Descartes’ ambitious and international team of 40+ is proud to protect 100+ clients – several from the Fortune 500 – in 60+ countries.\\n\\nOUR PURPOSE | Losses from catastrophes and man-made disasters are likely to increase year after year due to demographic density and climate change. We firmly believe that the insurance sector can and must play a critical role in helping enterprises and individuals cope with climate risk. This will... require, however, a deep transformation of the sector, as current insurance products often lack transparency, carry expensive premiums, and come with slow claims processing.\\n\\nOUR APPROACH | True to our namesake, René Descartes, one of the greatest European scientific philosophers of the 17th Century, our company draws a distinct advantage in challenging the approach adopted by traditional insurers.

We provide data-driven insurance products based on satellite imagery and IoT to protect corporate and public sector clients against climate risk and natural catastrophes. Following a Series A funding of 18m USD in September 2020, we opened offices in New York, Houston, Singapore, Sydney and London. Today, Descartes’ ambitious and international team of 40+ is proud to protect 100+ clients – several from the Fortune 500 – in 60+ countries.\\n\\nOUR PURPOSE | Losses from catastrophes and man-made disasters are likely to increase year after year due to demographic density and climate change. We firmly believe that the insurance sector can and must play a critical role in helping enterprises and individuals cope with climate risk. This will... require, however, a deep transformation of the sector, as current insurance products often lack transparency, carry expensive premiums, and come with slow claims processing.\\n\\nOUR APPROACH | True to our namesake, René Descartes, one of the greatest European scientific philosophers of the 17th Century, our company draws a distinct advantage in challenging the approach adopted by traditional insurers. Utilizing forward-looking models and real-time monitoring from satellite imagery, IoT and big data analytics, Descartes’ products help businesses bounce back faster.

Avec plus de 1000 clients dans le monde, nous déployons des solutions pour les plus grands projets depuis plus d\\'une décennie - tout ceci est rendu possible par une équipe internationale de 7 500 talents répartis sur les 5 continents et dans plus de 60 pays. Nos solutions sont axées sur quatre domaines d\\'activité différents : Les systèmes d\\'information et le digital, la télécommunication, les sciences de la vie et l\\'ingénierie. Nous cherchons à créer et à développer une communauté de talents où tous les membres de notre équipe peuvent réaliser leur plein potentiel. Amaris est votre « stepping stone » pour traverser les rivières du changement, pour relever les défis et pour réaliser tous vos projets avec succès.\\n\\nChez Amaris, nous avons à cœur d\\'offrir à nos candidats la meilleure expérience de recrutement possible. Nous cherchons à mieux connaître et comprendre nos... candidats, à les challenger et à leur faire part de nos impressions le plus rapidement possible. Voici à quoi ressemble notre processus de recrutement :\\n\\nPremier contact : Notre processus commence généralement par une brève conversation virtuelle/téléphonique pour en savoir plus sur vous ! L\\'objectif ? Apprendre à vous connaître, comprendre vos motivations et veiller à ce que nous vous proposions le poste qui vous correspond le mieux !\\n\\nEntretiens (en moyenne, le nombre d\\'entretiens est de 3 – il peut toutefois varier en fonction du niveau d\\'ancienneté requis pour le poste). Au cours des entretiens, vous rencontrerez les membres de notre équipe : votre supérieur hiérarchique bien sûr, mais aussi d\\'autres personnes avec lesquelles vous serez amené à travailler. Ces entretiens nous permettront d\\'en apprendre davantage sur vous, votre expérience et vos compétences, mais aussi sur le poste et ce que l\\'on attendra de vous. Bien entendu, vous apprendrez également à connaître Amaris : notre culture, notre histoire, nos équipes et vos opportunités de carrière !\\n\\nÉtude de cas: En fonction du poste, vous serez peut-être appelé à passer un test. Il pourra s\\'agir d\\'un jeu de rôle, d\\'une évaluation technique, d\\'un scénario de résolution de problème, etc.\\n\\nComme vous le savez, chaque personne est différente et il en va de même pour chaque rôle dans une entreprise.

We're an optimistic crew who naturally goes the extra mile, has a glass-half-full mindset, and sees challenges as opportunities. We look for positive people who think outside the box, are inventive, bold, lead change, and believe that teamwork matters. Team culture: Our job is to take numbers and turn them into reasons to celebrate! Data drives everything we do at Jellysmack and is thus essential to the company. Data is at the heart of our success, and it drives the content we create and how we edit videos so we can optimize everything we publish. Everyone on our team is capable of going above and beyond the call of duty. Our goal is to gather and analyze data to help the company grow. Do you have what it takes to be part of our team? Your mission: As a Data Scientist, you will be responsible for product development using data science, all in... a strong spirit of collaboration. You will also participate in a guild made up of twelve data scientists (3 Phds, 3 Xs, 2 ENSs, 1 Supaeros, 1 Centrales...) to share knowledge. You will also have the opportunity to be a mentor for more junior profiles at the algorithmic level and work on our current Data Science projects- we already have over 40 algorithms in production. What you’ll be responsible for: • Understanding the business challenges of the squad and converting them into a Data Science problem. • Setting up Time Series POCs and measuring the business impact. • Industrializing and deploying MVPs in production while ensuring quality throughout the process. • Supporting junior profiles, be able to popularize complex algorithms and take on a mentoring role on the Data team. Some examples of NLP topics: • Sentiment analysis on video comments. • Extraction of topics from titles, descriptions, comments of videos. • Video analysis (content and metadata) to better understand user retention. • Automatic generation of video titles and tags. • Text / dialog summary generator. Jellysmack’s technical Stack: • Language : Python, C++, Julia (to be “re”-tested) • Databases : Aurora, Redshift, ElasticSearch on AWS • Librairies : Pandas, PyTorch, Tensorflow, Scikit-learn, SQLAlchemy,... • Visualisation : PowerBI, Plotly, Seaborn, bokeh • DevOps: Gitlab, Airflow, MLFlow, Docker • Environment : We use Pycharm, VSCode, VIM and Jupyter but we’re open to anything on any OS! A little about you: • You have a doctorate in Computer Science or a master's degree in Data Science, you have at least 2 years of RL-oriented experience. • Industrialization is important to you and you know how to push algorithms in production independently. • You like to share your knowledge and you act as a mentor for the other members of the team. • You have a very good level of SQL (MySQL and PostgreSQL) and notions of NoSQL. Our “Work from Anywhere” philosophy: Jellysmack believes in a flexible work environment in which anyone can work from anywhere. This is why we’ve implemented our flexible location philosophy, meaning you get the best of both worlds: you can choose to work from home and / or from our offices in Paris, New York, Los Angeles and Corti. In order to make sure you get the best working environment, you will get a EUR 250 allowance to get set up! Nota bene: your residence must be in the country in which you are applying Perks at Jellysmack: • Clubs (cooking, art, talks, sports) • Paid volunteering: 1 day dedicated to supporting a cause of your choice • Wellness (fitness, yoga, meditation) • Healthcare coverage • Daily meal vouchers The Jellysmack difference: Jellysmack’s story started in 2016, and since then, our unrivaled platform optimizes and distributes video content across social media platforms and allows creators to reach genuine new fans with zero effort. We are the only company building the hyper-engaged communities that every creator dreams of because, first and foremost, we are creators too. Currently home to over 420+ influential Creators, including Brad Mondo, Bailey Sarian, and Emmymade, Jellysmack optimizes, operates, and distributes creator-made video content to Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, TikTok, Twitter, and YouTube. The company’s creator strategy builds upon its success in scaling its own original content channels in beauty (“Beauty Studio”), soccer (“Oh My Goal”), gaming (“Gamology”), and more. Through the power of our data, we maximize reach and revenue so our creators can stay focused on their passion—creating the best content and entertaining fans around the world. We turn that passion into a brand and that brand into an empire. Our commitment to diversity and inclusion At Jellysmack, we believe that the best ideas come from the diverse cultures of our team members. Our commitment to inclusion across race, gender, age, religion, identity, and experience drives us forward every day. Creating a work culture that is safe and comfortable for our people to flourish is our main focus. Ready to be part of a great human adventure? We’re dedicated to making the best working environment possible for our people. All you have to do is apply; we are ready to let you show off your talent\",\n",

Everyone on our team is capable of going above and beyond the call of duty. Our goal is to gather and analyze data to help the company grow. Do you have what it takes to be part of our team? Your mission: As a Data Scientist, you will be responsible for product development using data science, all in... a strong spirit of collaboration. You will also participate in a guild made up of twelve data scientists (3 Phds, 3 Xs, 2 ENSs, 1 Supaeros, 1 Centrales...) to share knowledge. You will also have the opportunity to be a mentor for more junior profiles at the algorithmic level and work on our current Data Science projects- we already have over 40 algorithms in production. What you’ll be responsible for: • Understanding the business challenges of the squad and converting them into a Data Science problem. • Setting up Time Series POCs and measuring the business impact. • Industrializing and deploying MVPs in production while ensuring quality throughout the process. • Supporting junior profiles, be able to popularize complex algorithms and take on a mentoring role on the Data team. Some examples of NLP topics: • Sentiment analysis on video comments. • Extraction of topics from titles, descriptions, comments of videos. • Video analysis (content and metadata) to better understand user retention. • Automatic generation of video titles and tags. • Text / dialog summary generator. Jellysmack’s technical Stack: • Language : Python, C++, Julia (to be “re”-tested) • Databases : Aurora, Redshift, ElasticSearch on AWS • Librairies : Pandas, PyTorch, Tensorflow, Scikit-learn, SQLAlchemy,... • Visualisation : PowerBI, Plotly, Seaborn, bokeh • DevOps: Gitlab, Airflow, MLFlow, Docker • Environment : We use Pycharm, VSCode, VIM and Jupyter but we’re open to anything on any OS! A little about you: • You have a doctorate in Computer Science or a master's degree in Data Science, you have at least 2 years of RL-oriented experience. • Industrialization is important to you and you know how to push algorithms in production independently. • You like to share your knowledge and you act as a mentor for the other members of the team. • You have a very good level of SQL (MySQL and PostgreSQL) and notions of NoSQL. Our “Work from Anywhere” philosophy: Jellysmack believes in a flexible work environment in which anyone can work from anywhere. This is why we’ve implemented our flexible location philosophy, meaning you get the best of both worlds: you can choose to work from home and / or from our offices in Paris, New York, Los Angeles and Corti. In order to make sure you get the best working environment, you will get a EUR 250 allowance to get set up! Nota bene: your residence must be in the country in which you are applying Perks at Jellysmack: • Clubs (cooking, art, talks, sports) • Paid volunteering: 1 day dedicated to supporting a cause of your choice • Wellness (fitness, yoga, meditation) • Healthcare coverage • Daily meal vouchers The Jellysmack difference: Jellysmack’s story started in 2016, and since then, our unrivaled platform optimizes and distributes video content across social media platforms and allows creators to reach genuine new fans with zero effort. We are the only company building the hyper-engaged communities that every creator dreams of because, first and foremost, we are creators too. Currently home to over 420+ influential Creators, including Brad Mondo, Bailey Sarian, and Emmymade, Jellysmack optimizes, operates, and distributes creator-made video content to Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, TikTok, Twitter, and YouTube. The company’s creator strategy builds upon its success in scaling its own original content channels in beauty (“Beauty Studio”), soccer (“Oh My Goal”), gaming (“Gamology”), and more. Through the power of our data, we maximize reach and revenue so our creators can stay focused on their passion—creating the best content and entertaining fans around the world. We turn that passion into a brand and that brand into an empire. Our commitment to diversity and inclusion At Jellysmack, we believe that the best ideas come from the diverse cultures of our team members. Our commitment to inclusion across race, gender, age, religion, identity, and experience drives us forward every day. Creating a work culture that is safe and comfortable for our people to flourish is our main focus. Ready to be part of a great human adventure? We’re dedicated to making the best working environment possible for our people. All you have to do is apply; we are ready to let you show off your talent\"]}],\n",
